## Requirement Completeness

- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- All 16 items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

- Retention default of 7 days was assumed based on industry standards.
- SQLite-only for MVP was assumed (no LanceDB).
